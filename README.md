# Breathe London
The web platform that provided the data, maps and visualisations for the Breathe London website.

## Web Platform
[CERC](https://cerc.co.uk/environmental-research/web-platforms.html) developed the web platform that provided the data, maps and visualisations for the Breathe London website. 
The platform uses the Google Cloud, which enables user-friendly performance when querying these large datasets to provide graphs and visualisations, 
and ensures the replicability and scalability of the platform to other cities around the world. 
The platform is capable of displaying near-real-time data from Breathe London's AQMesh sensors and also other monitor networks such as the London Air Quality Network.
The platform is open-source and so it is freely replicable by other cities around the world that wish to build their own platform.

## Breathe London Pilot
The Breathe London pilot was funded by the [Clean Air Fund](https://www.cleanairfund.org/) and delivered by a consortium led by [Environmental Defense Fund Europe](https://www.edfeurope.org/) 
with partners including Google, University of Cambridge, CERC, ACOEM and NPL. The pilot Breathe London project was devised by City Hall, the [Children’s Investment Fund Foundation](https://ciff.org/) 
and [C40 Cities](https://www.c40.org/) – the leading global alliance of cities committed to addressing climate change.
